# odin-project-recipes
odin project data!

hello this is me vaibhav and im trying all the git commands by my self.

what have i learned so far is the we have to first clone the reository we want to work on like in my case i want to work on odin-project-recipes.
: git clone "code of ssh" 
then the directory is downloaded to the present working directory.
the we made changes to the directory or create a new file or delete some.

after making changes to the desired files we will first do is: 

:git add -> to add the changes to the files.

:git status -> to check the status of the file.

:git commit -F "filename" -> to commit changes to te file (it is like a register so that we can keep the track of the changes we have made in the working file). it is very useful and easy to make changes. 

: gti commit -m "message for the file we have made changes to so that we can know what we have changed in the file from start to end". 

: git push origin main -> to push the changes to the main repository and save the file in the remote servers of github.

our work is done.
